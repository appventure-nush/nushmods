**Brief Summary**

NUSHMods is a school project inspired by NUSMods, where information about NUS High's modules and teachers are displayed for guests. It also helps students keep track of homework across classes. Since the CS curriculum in Year 6 Semester 1 is about database systems, especially relational databases, this project makes use of MySQL, a popular management system, to store the module, teacher and homework data. MySQL also allows for functionalities such as querying, filtering, and (for teachers) even modifying the data. The information is presented through a web interface built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Python (Flask) and Javascript.
