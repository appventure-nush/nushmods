    "Moving from outside to inside, we start off with departments. A **department** has a unique department code, name, and a general description for the department / subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each department can host multiple modules. Each module belongs to exactly 1 department. A **module** has a unique module code, title, description, semesters (not a multi-valued attribute in this case, as a module can either span more than 2 semesters or be available for either of 2 semesters, for example), number of modular credits, type (core, elective, etc.; derived from module code), as well as hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some modules can be **offered** (being taught in the current semester). An offered module has a general overview (outline, module information, etc. that is targeted to students taking the module).\n",
    "\n",
    "An offered module can consist of multiple classes (e.g. CS6131 has 2 classes, CS6131_603 and CS6131_604). Each class belongs to exactly 1 module. A **class** has a name, and a general overview (class-specific details for the module, teacher information / expectations etc.). The class name need not be unique, but classes in the same module must have unique names.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can have multiple lessons. Each lesson belongs to exactly 1 class. A **lesson** has a start day (of the week), start time, and number of hours. The start day of a lesson is unique only within a specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **item** has a unique id, title, description and date (date plays 2 roles here). Firstly, an item must be either an **announcement** or a **dated**. For an announcement, the date attribute is used as the post date, while for a dated, it is used as the deadline. An announcement has a priority, while a dated has a type (e.g. homework and assessments) and weightage. Finally, an item must be either a **class item** (targeted at 1 class) or a **module item** (targeted at an entire module).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we describe the users, starting off with students. A **student** has a unique student id. It also has the attributes name, password and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **teacher** has a unique staff id. Each teacher belongs to exactly 1 department, and a department can have multiple teachers. A teacher has an email, name, pasword, prefix (Mr. / Ms. / etc.) and phone number. A teacher can teach multiple classes, while a class must be taught by at least 1 teacher. Each class item is created by exactly 1 teacher-class combination (a particular teacher teaching a particular class), and each teacher-class combination can create multiple class items.\n",
    "\n",
    "A teacher can also be a **coordinator**, **HOD**, and/or a **mentor**. Each coordinator must coordinate at least 1 offered module, and each offered module is coordinated by exactly 1 coordinator. Each module item is created by exactly 1 coordinator-offered module combination (a particular coordinator coordinating a particular offered module), and each coordinator-offered module combination can create multiple module items. A HOD heads exactly 1 a department, and each department has exactly 1 HOD. A mentor has a mentor group (attribute). Each mentor must mentor at least 1 student, while each student has exactly 1 mentor (this also means that every student will identify with exactly 1 mentor group (through their associated mentor)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each student can take multiple classes, each class can be taken by multiple students, each student can request for a consultation with multiple teachers, and each teacher can be consulted by multiple students. There can be only 1 request between a particular student and teacher at a time, with attributes time (including date), description and approved (true / false / null (pending))."

Students will gain an introduction to the three independent disciplines by means of an Integrated Humanities course of study. They shall then have the option of pursuing either History or Geography in Years 2 – 3; and History, Geography or Economics in Years 4 - 6.\\n\\nIntegrated Humanities\\n\\nThe Integrated Humanities curriculum serves to lay the foundation for the three Humanities disciplines taught by the Department. Concepts and skills fundamental to the respective disciplines are imparted to prepare students holistically to manage the subjects at higher levels.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe History curriculum at NUS High School aims to provide students with a broader worldview and a better understanding of present global trends and international relations through a contemporary study of regional and international developments in the twentieth century. It highlights the importance of understanding and interpreting history in all its complexity – its people, events, developments and issues are explored in a historical context and examined from a range of perspectives. It enables students to better understand how the world they live in is shaped by the historical forces of the recent past.\\n\\nThe curriculum adopts a multi-faceted approach, and is designed around knowledge that is enduring and is organised around key themes and concepts or the “Big Ideas” that will guide students’ thinking and the learning outcomes. Constructivist teaching is emphasized which focuses on developing students to be active learners, as they engage in the learning to construct their own meanings.\\n\\nGeography\\n\\nThe Geography curriculum is designed to manifest the dynamism of the subject as students study the interactions between man and the environment over time and space at the local, regional and global scales. It integrates both physical and human geography, and provides for the acquisition of scientific and socio-economic methodologies.\\n\\nThe curriculum focuses on the study and investigation of cause-effect relationships between man and the environment through the identification of trends and patterns, and the processes behind them. This is followed by the subsequent investigation into the adaptations, measures and management strategies meant to cope and deal with these interactions. Through the use of relevant named examples and case studies, the curriculum ensures that the consideration of varied perspectives, ideas and views is inherent in the curriculum. The Geography curriculum thus aims to develop in our students the values and attitudes of responsible citizens of an increasingly interconnected world. It will also strive to motivate them to reach a level of personal commitment to resolve the issues at different scales.\\n\\nEconomics\\n\\nThe study of Economics aims to provide students a broad understanding of national and international economic issues and challenges them to think critically through experiential learning and research. It aims to challenge students to investigate the economic issues on strategies of firms, efficiency, market failure and macroeconomic developments in the regional and international economies. Students will examine real world case studies; provide economic insights and conduct research and explore alternatives to achieve key economic goals.\\n\\nEconomics as a social science will broaden students’ thinking as they examine human behaviour in response to changes and the way decisions are being made. Economics has a vital role to play in promoting international cooperation and mutual understanding because of its focus on global issues. To achieve this understanding, students will need to learn to consider economic theories, ideas, and events from the points of view of different stakeholders in the world economy.\\n\\n\\n'\n",

Students will gain an introduction to Music in Year 1. They will then have the option of pursuing Music in Years 2 and 3, as well as majoring in Music from Years 4 to 6. Each module represents a minimum of 12-15 weeks of classroom instruction per semester. Each modular credit is equivalent to 50 minutes of the class time. Some of the modules can be self-contained while others are taught in spiral sequence.\\n\\nStudents aiming to choose Music as a 4th major may do so by completing all CORE music modules. These CORE Modules offer students a broad-based exposure and a general overview of the subject so as to increase the students’ general musical knowledge, the depth of understanding and appreciation of the subject matter. These modules lay a strong foundation for the fundamental concepts and principles of music. Grades of Year 3 to 6 Core modules are counted toward the Cumulative Average Point (CAP).\\n\\nWe acknowledge that\\n1. the individual students will not necessarily be practitioners of the arts, few may choose it as a career,\\n2. still more may pursue it as an avocation, and\\n3. most of the students will be the mass audience for the culture of their times.\\n\\nHowever, we want to foster in our students the appreciation and understanding of the arts so to allow them a lifelong source of enjoyment.\\n\\nAssessment\\n\\nThe music program will explore various modes of assessment: Authentic (skill demonstration, performance-based and task-oriented); Formative (For learning: what new insights have students brought to their music making during this lesson or unit of work-carried out throughout a course or project—process); and Summative (Of learning—record the overall achievement of a student-end of a course or project—measures learning outcomes).\\n\\nThe assessment ranges from individual practical examinations to submitted projects and presentations–with emphasis on authentic assessments. Each module carries its own specific Continual Assessment (60%) requirement such as Quizzes/Tests, Assignment (in theory or in practical aspects), Projects, Concert Reports; and a Final Examination or Project (40%) or entirely 100% Continual Assessment.\\n\\nStudents experience both the reflective preparations and drafting and revision of work. At the other extreme, aside from learning to improvise, sight-read/sing, and generally ‘think on their feet,’ students are strongly encouraged to be assessed by external examination boards such as the ABRSM or Trinity for benchmarking purposes.\\n\\nLearning Outcomes\\n\\nThe Music & Art Department promotes and cultivates awareness and appreciation through the Aesthetic Appreciation Program, nurtures passionate students through curriculum and department activities that contribute to the total development of the individual. This development enhances also the 21st century competencies and the MOE’s Desired Outcomes (Confident Person, Self-Directed Learner, Active Contributor, Concerned Citizen). School and community resources are used to facilitate the exploration of music and art in a manner both meaningful and relevant to students. Majoring students would have attained the skills and knowledge that will prepare them for tertiary level education and beyond.\\n\\nWhen students can relate and apply their knowledge and ideas, and are able to, associate, apply, analyze and synthesize through the learning processes for themselves, they are equipped with skills and competencies which will allow for lifelong learning to occur.

Upon completion of either course, students are required to sit for the GCE ‘O’ Level HMTL Exam at end of Year 4 or GCE ‘A’ Level H1 MTL Exam at end of Year 5.<br><br>With approval from MOE, students who offer a Mother Tongue in-lieu at one of the MOEapproved centres will be deemed to have offered the Mother Tongue in-lieu concerned as a core module in our school. For such modules, ‘M’ is indicated at the end of the module code. For example, BG1531M denotes the module code for Bengali IA (Semester 1) in the case of students taking the Bengali (Non-Tamil Indian Language) module conducted at a MOEapproved centre.<br><br>For students who find it difficult to cope with MTL modules, they can opt to take up MTL Syllabus ‘B’ modules instead. However, approval must be sought from the school before opting for MTL Syllabus ‘B’ modules and the opting can only be carried out at appropriate stages. MTL Syllabus ‘B’ modules are offered to students as Enrichment Modules. Upon taking up the MTL Syllabus ‘B’ course, students are to complete this course and pass GCE A Level MTL ‘B” Exam at end of Year 5.<br><br>In order to further develop in students the capacity and interest for Mother Tongue languages, the school also offers elective modules to students taking MTL or HMTL course. Elective modules, such as Appreciation of Chinese Language and Culture, Basic Translation Skills, The Math and Science Achievements of Ancient China and Learning Math and Science in Chinese, aim to strengthen the language acquisition of students and develop in them the ability to apprehend the culture associated with the language.<br><br>FOREIGN/ THIRD LANGUAGE MODULES (FRENCH/ JAPANESE/ CHINESE/ MALAY)<br><br>The school offers French, Japanese, Chinese as 3rd Lang and Malay as 3rd Lang as Elective Modules. These modules are offered to the following categories of students:<br>(1) Having the interest to study a Third Lang on top of their Mother Tongue<br>(2) Opting to study French or Japanese as MTL-in-lieu (with approval from MOE)<br>(3) Having the interest to study one of these languages purely for interest, even if they are exempted from MTL (this applies to some of the foreign students)<br><br>The four-year French and Japanese courses prepare students for DELF (Diploma in French Studies) &amp; JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) respectively. The four-year Chinese as 3rd Lang and Malay as 3rd Lang courses equip students with language competencies required for sitting for GCE ‘O’ Level Chinese/Malay Special Programme even though some of them may not be eligible to sit for these exams.<br><br>Upon completion of any of the 4 third language courses mentioned above, students are expected to achieve communicative competence in simple everyday situations and personal interaction in French, Japanese, Chinese or Malay. Having attained this level of learning would indicate that students have acquired the language foundation necessary for advancement to the next level of learning.<br><br><br><br><br><br></td>\n",

It is our mission to provide a quality music program that is an integral part of the entire education as well as a reflection of a well-balanced education experience. School and community resources are used to facilitate the exploration of music in a manner both meaningful and relevant to students. Students majoring in music—upon recommendation— will also enjoy the collaboration opportunities with higher institutions. The music program will enhance students’ learning through the acquisition of<br>- Music Knowledge and Reading<br>- Music Listening and Analysis<br>- Music Composition and Performance<br><br>The music program will develop students in achieving these learning competencies and to strive for excellence within the limits of their individual capabilities in three areas: Skill Development, Musical Understanding, and Attitude Development.<br><br>Expected Requirements<br><br>Applied Instrument:<br><br>Students majoring in Music must try to attain at least a Grade 8 standard of the Associated Board of Royal School of Music (ABRSM) or beyond for the first musical instrument and a Grade 5 standard ABRSM for the second instrument by Year 6. Majoring students will study or continue to learn the applied instruments* with their external music teachers who will prepare them for examination boards such as the ABRSM or Trinity College London (TCL). Each level grows from those experiences previously presented.<br>*Please check with HOD for the approved applied instruments<br><br>Performing Opportunities: Senior Recital and CCA Performing Arts:<br>Aside from fulfilling the applied instruments requirement, music majors are also required to:<br>- present a Senior Recital in Year 6<br>- participate in one of the CCA Performing Arts group: School Orchestra or Chinese Orchestra or Choir (based on their 1st instrument)<br><br>We hope to provide music majors the opportunities to explore in and out of school music activities and the study of an orchestra instrument during his or her high school education.<br><br>Design of Curriculum<br><br>Music curriculum is deliberately made flexible in order to meet the needs of students within a variety of facilities and school timetable structures. Students will gain an introduction to Music in Year 1. They will then have the option of pursuing Music in Years 2 and 3, as well as majoring in Music from Years 4 to 6. Each module represents a minimum of 12-15 weeks of classroom instruction per semester. Each modular credit is equivalent to 50 minutes of the class time. Some of the modules can be self-contained while others are taught in spiral sequence.<br><br>Students aiming to choose Music as a 4th major may do so by completing all CORE music modules. These CORE Modules offer students a broad-based exposure and a general overview of the subject so as to increase the students’ general musical knowledge, the depth of understanding and appreciation of the subject matter. These modules lay a strong foundation for the fundamental concepts and principles of music. Grades of Year 3 to 6 Core modules are counted toward the Cumulative Average Point (CAP).<br><br>We acknowledge that<br>1. the individual students will not necessarily be practitioners of the arts, few may choose it as a career,<br>2. still more may pursue it as an avocation, and<br>3. most of the students will be the mass audience for the culture of their times.<br><br>However, we want to foster in our students the appreciation and understanding of the arts so to allow them a lifelong source of enjoyment.<br><br>Assessment<br><br>The music program will explore various modes of assessment: Authentic (skill demonstration, performance-based and task-oriented); Formative (For learning: what new insights have students brought to their music making during this lesson or unit of work-carried out throughout a course or project—process); and Summative (Of learning—record the overall achievement of a student-end of a course or project—measures learning outcomes).<br><br>The assessment ranges from individual practical examinations to submitted projects and presentations–with emphasis on authentic assessments. Each module carries its own specific Continual Assessment (60%) requirement such as Quizzes/Tests, Assignment (in theory or in practical aspects), Projects, Concert Reports; and a Final Examination or Project (40%) or entirely 100% Continual Assessment.<br><br>Students experience both the reflective preparations and drafting and revision of work. At the other extreme, aside from learning to improvise, sight-read/sing, and generally ‘think on their feet,’ students are strongly encouraged to be assessed by external examination boards such as the ABRSM or Trinity for benchmarking purposes.<br><br>Learning Outcomes<br><br>The Music &amp; Art Department promotes and cultivates awareness and appreciation through the Aesthetic Appreciation Program, nurtures passionate students through curriculum and department activities that contribute to the total development of the individual.

The module begins with a macro perspective of life by getting students to explore how biotic and abiotic factors may influence the diversity and distribution of organisms, and discuss ethical issues related to the environment. Next, students will zoom into the study of the building blocks of life – cells. In order to support life, movement of biological molecules into and out of cells must occur – therefore mechanisms through which this can be facilitated are also subsequently studied. The biological molecules that move in and out of cells are also studied in detail; and students will also carry out investigations regarding how these substances can be identified. Lastly, students will explore the fate of biological molecules in both animal and plant systems with regards to nutrition. Three biological themes are addressed at various points during the module: the correlation between structure and function, the relation between a system and its parts, as well as the flow of energy through biological units. The discussion of bioethical issues is also infused at appropriate points. At the end of the module, it is hoped that students will be inspired to develop a passion for biology through acquiring a deep understanding of the concepts taught and awareness of their applications to daily life, through frequent hands‐on activities designed to develop practical skills in a scaffolded manner, as well as through excursions and discussions.</td>\n",
